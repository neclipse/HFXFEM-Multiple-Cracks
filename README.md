# HFXFEM-Verified-Singlecrack
This Matlab package is developed following the Object-oriented paradiagm. The theoretical details will be available in our latest [publication](https://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/SPE-204476-PA) early 2021.

The core structure is inherited from my other [repository](https://github.com/neclipse/FEA-in-Matlab-NSMOOM).

The master branch is verified for single crack against latest analytical solution (Dontsov 2017).
Please consider to use the two algorithm flowcharts and one class aggregation map for quick understanding of the package.
